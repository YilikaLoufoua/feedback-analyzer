That being said, I do like some of the hands-on coding activities.\n\nI already feel behind because of the late start on Lab 1 yesterday (technical difficulties with codepath and everything) and because CSS is my biggest weakness; in all honesty, seeing people who clearly had front-end web dev experience present their gorgeous sites at the end of the day felt really discouraging.",
